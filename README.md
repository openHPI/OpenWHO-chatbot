# Support Bot

## Introduction

Chatbots are text-based and automated dialogue systems, that allow to communicate with a computer-based system in natural language. They are divided into three categories. Support chatbots are specialized to answer questions from a specific domain. Skills chatbots have a predefined set of rules, e.g. to control the lights in your home. And assistant chatbots are a combination of support and skills chatbots. Alexa or Siri are two of the most popular ones.

Recent years have shown a rise in chatbots on the internet. Reason for this are not only the advancements in machine learning, but also how relatively easy it has become to build a chatbot with services like Dialogflow, Wit.ai or Microsoftâ€™s Bot Framework. Often previous knowledge in machine learning is not required. Machine learning also allows for more complex chatbots. Although it is possible to build a chatbot with only a set of rules manifested in if-else-statements, at a certain point it is not feasible to maintain. Machine learning solves this by training a model from a set of example utterances and dialogues which evolves over time.

## Architecture

[Rasa](https://rasa.com/) is an open source platform for building chat bots. It consists of two major parts: the Rasa Core and the Rasa NLU. 

## Setup

### Training

```sh
    rasa train --data data/openWHO -c config.yml -d openWHO/domain.yml --out models/openWHO
```

### Usage

1. Start docker in the outer project structure

```sh
    docker run -p8001:8000 rasa/duckling
```

2. Inside /rasa start Action Server (only for openSAP)

```sh
    rasa run actions -vv --actions actions.openSAP.account
```

3. Inside /rasa start rasa

```sh
    rasa run -vv -m models/openWHO --enable-api --log-file out.log --endpoints endpoints.yml --credentials credentials.yml
```
